# Hey I'm [Pramithi](https://pramitij.github.io) 👋 Welcome to my GitHub!

### 👩🏽‍💻 Software Engineer | 💻 Full-Stack Developer | 🤖 Machine Learning Enthusiast

I'm a Software Engineer with experience across backend and full-stack development, with an eye for integrating Machine Learning and robust Cloud Infrastructure to build solutions that drive efficiency, scalability, and stability. From optimizing robotic performance at Amazon Robotics to pioneering data operations at Accenture, I've embraced the challenge of driving efficiency in every line of code. 

As a grad student at Northeastern University, I've been learning and experimenting with a bunch of fun technologies, check out some of my recent Projects exploring Practical applications of GenAI using the transformative power of LLMs.

### 💡 Recent Projects

- [CNN Architectural Variations: Performance Study](https://github.com/pramitij/CNN-Architectural-Variations-Performance-Study) -  I investigate how various architectural modifications within a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) impact its ability to classify CIFAR-10 images. Specifically, I explore the effects of Batch Normalization, Dropout, the number of convolution and pooling layers, and different activation functions on the model's performance.
- [Generative AI Chatbot](https://github.com/pramitij/LLM-Powered-Travel-Agency-ChatBot) - Developed a sophisticated chatbot leveraging OpenAI’s GPT-4 for natural dialogue, integrated with a custom database and RAG system to provide intuitive context-aware responses through a Streamlit web interface
- [Medical-Image-Generation](https://github.com/pramitij/Medical-Image-Generation) - Leveraging ML models to build a system that generates images of skin rashes based on textual commands using stable-diffusion and dreambooth.
